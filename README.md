manitesto - a party manifesto tracker

It was developed during HackIIITD, a hackathon event organised during IIITD's tech fest "esya'15".

It has managed to stay in prototype phase only.

It offers to add each promise in a manifesto as a 'test' which will be critiqued, ranked and evaluated by the public.
A poltical party has to pass these 'tests' to stay in session in the next elections.
Hence the name 'manitesto' !

each test has a detailed page showing progress, comments and other details along with a result of that particular test.

other topics to develop on were:
